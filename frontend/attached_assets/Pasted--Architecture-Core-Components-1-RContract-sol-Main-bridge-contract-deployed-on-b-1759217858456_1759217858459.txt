## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **RContract.sol**: Main bridge contract deployed on both L1 and L2
2. **RBridge.sol**: Reactive orchestrator that listens to cross-chain events and triggers callbacks
3. **Market Maker System**: Liquidity providers earn premiums for filling orders
4. **Price Feed Integration**: Chainlink oracles for fair pricing and slippage protection

### Cross-Chain Flow

```
L1: OrderPlaced (topic=0) → RBridge → L2: callbackReceiveOrder
L2: OrderFillRequested (topic=2) → RBridge → L1: callbackCompleteFill
L1: FillCompleted (topic=3) → RBridge → L2: callbackFinalizeOrder
```

## Key Problems Faced and Solutions

### 1. Encoding/Decoding Mismatch

**Problem**: Initial implementation used `keccak256(abi.encodePacked())` for encoding order data, but tried to decode it as raw ABI data in callbacks.

```solidity
// BROKEN - Not reversible
bytes32 orderHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(orderId, originChain, tokenA, tokenB, amount));
```

**Solution**: Changed to proper ABI encoding for reversible data serialization:

```solidity
// FIXED - Properly reversible
bytes memory tokenConfig = abi.encode(tokenA, tokenB, amount);
bytes memory orderConfig = abi.encode(minFillAmount, duration, slippage, usePriceFeed);
```

**Impact**: Enabled proper cross-chain data transfer and event decoding.

### 2. Order Cancellation Deadlock

**Problem**: Users had no way to cancel orders, leading to potential permanent fund locks if orders weren't filled.

**Original Issue**: No cancellation mechanism existed.

**Solution**: Implemented sophisticated cross-chain cancellation system:

```solidity
struct Order {
    // ... existing fields
    bool isCancelled;
    bool cancellationRequested;
}

function requestCancellation(uint256 orderId) external {
    Order storage order = orders[orderId];
    require(msg.sender == order.orderer, "NOT_ORDERER");
    require(!order.isFilled && !order.isCancelled, "INVALID_STATE");

    order.cancellationRequested = true;
    emit OrderCancellationRequested(5, orderId, chainId, order.destinationChain, msg.sender);
}
```

**Anti-MEV Design**: Used cross-chain callbacks instead of time delays to prevent sandwich attacks during cancellation windows.

### 3. Fee Collection Misunderstanding

**Problem**: Initially thought protocol fees weren't being collected properly.

**Misconception**: Assumed fees needed explicit ledger tracking.

**Reality**: User implemented implicit fee collection by deducting full amount but transferring less:

```solidity
uint256 protocolFee = (amountToSend * oConfig.protocolFeeBps) / 10000;
uint256 finalAmountToSend = amountToSend - protocolFee;

// Transfer only finalAmountToSend, keeping protocolFee in contract
IERC20(tConfig.tokenB).transfer(order.orderer, finalAmountToSend);
```

**Insight**: This approach is more gas-efficient than maintaining separate fee ledgers.

### 4. Slippage Check Logic Error

**Problem**: Test failed with "SLIPPAGE_EXCEEDED" error during market maker premium scenarios.

**Root Cause**: Slippage check was performed after adding premium, treating premium as unwanted slippage:

```solidity
// BROKEN - Premium counted as slippage
uint256 amountToSend = baseAmount + premium;
require(amountToSend >= expectedAmount - slippageTolerance, "SLIPPAGE_EXCEEDED");
```

**Solution**: Check slippage on base amount, then add premium as intentional extra cost:

```solidity
// FIXED - Premium separate from slippage
require(baseAmountToSend >= expectedAmount - slippageTolerance, "SLIPPAGE_EXCEEDED");
uint256 premiumAmount = (baseAmountToSend * oConfig.premiumBps) / 10000;
uint256 amountToSend = baseAmountToSend + premiumAmount;
```

**Key Insight**: Premium is intentional value-add, not unwanted price deviation.

### 5. Cross-Chain Token Address Inconsistency

**Problem**: Using L2 token addresses on L1 for price feed calculations fails because token addresses differ across chains.

**Example Scenario**:
- Order placed on L2 with L2 USDC address
- L1 trying to get price feed for L2 USDC address
- L1 price feed registry doesn't recognize L2 addresses

**Solution Discussed**: Origin→canonical token mapping system:

```solidity
// Map: originChain → originTokenAddress → canonicalTokenAddress
mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => address)) public originToCanonical;

function getCanonicalToken(uint256 originChain, address originToken)
    public view returns (address) {
    return originToCanonical[originChain][originToken];
}
```

**Implementation Strategy**: Use canonical token addresses (e.g., mainnet addresses) as universal identifiers across all chains.

### 6. Market Maker Incentive Design

**Challenge**: Create sustainable economics where LPs are incentivized to provide liquidity.

**Solution**: Dual-fee structure:
- **Premium**: Paid by orderer to LP as incentive (configurable basis points)
- **Protocol Fee**: Paid by both orderer and filler to protocol treasury

```solidity
struct OrderConfig {
    uint256 premiumBps;      // LP incentive (e.g., 50 bps = 0.5%)
    uint256 protocolFeeBps;  // Protocol fee (e.g., 10 bps = 0.1%)
}
```

**Economics**:
- Orderers pay premium for faster fills
- LPs earn premium for providing liquidity
- Protocol earns sustainable revenue
- Market efficiency through competitive pricing

## Technical Innovations

### 1. Reactive Network Integration

Used event-driven architecture instead of traditional cross-chain messaging:

```solidity
function react(LogRecord calldata log) external vmOnly {
    if (log.topic_1 == 0) {
        // OrderPlaced: Route to destination chain
    } else if (log.topic_1 == 2) {
        // OrderFillRequested: Route to origin chain
    }
    // ... handle all event types
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Lower latency than traditional bridges
- Event-driven reactive programming model
- Built-in message ordering and reliability

### 2. Flexible Price Feed System

Integrated Chainlink oracles with configurable slippage protection:

```solidity
if (oConfig.usePriceFeed) {
    uint256 expectedAmount = tokenRegistry.convertAmount(
        tConfig.tokenA, tConfig.tokenB,
        order.amount, tConfig.decimalsA, tConfig.decimalsB
    );
    uint256 slippageTolerance = (expectedAmount * oConfig.slippage) / 10000;
    require(baseAmountToSend >= expectedAmount - slippageTolerance, "SLIPPAGE_EXCEEDED");
}
```

**Features**:
- Optional price feed usage per order
- Configurable slippage tolerance
- Multi-decimal token support
- Fair market pricing

### 3. Anti-MEV Cancellation

Prevented sandwich attacks during cancellation through cross-chain coordination:

```solidity
// Step 1: Request cancellation on origin chain
function requestCancellation(uint256 orderId) external {
    order.cancellationRequested = true;
    emit OrderCancellationRequested(/* cross-chain event */);
}

// Step 2: Destination chain marks as cancelled
function markOrderAsCanceledCallbackL2(/* params */) external {
    order.isCancelled = true;
    emit OrderCancelled(/* notify origin chain */);
}

// Step 3: Origin chain finalizes cancellation
function markOrderAsCanceledCallbackL1(/* params */) external {
    order.isCancelled = true;
    // Refund user
}
```

**Security**: No time windows for MEV attacks, atomic cross-chain state updates.
