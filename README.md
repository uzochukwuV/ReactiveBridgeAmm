## <ï¿½ Overview

PowBridge is a next-generation cross-chain bridge protocol that enables **trustless token swaps** between blockchains with **built-in market maker incentives**. Unlike traditional bridges, PowBridge uses an event-driven reactive architecture for near-instant cross-chain communication and provides sustainable economics for liquidity providers.

### Key Features

- =ï¿½ **Market Maker Incentives**: Earn premiums for providing liquidity
- =ï¿½ **Anti-MEV Protection**: Cross-chain coordination prevents sandwich attacks
- =ï¿½ **Chainlink Integration**: Optional price feeds for fair market pricing

## =ï¿½ How It Works

### The Simple Version

1. **Alice** wants to swap 1000 USDC (on Sepolia) for 1 ETH (on Optimism)
2. Alice creates an order with a **2% premium** for market makers
3. **Bob** (market maker) sees the order and fills it on Optimism
4. The protocol automatically settles: Alice gets her ETH, Bob gets his USDC + premium
5. Everyone's happy! <ï¿½
